# ARjournal

Journaling is a helpful way to process, reflect, and express your thoughts and feelings. This can be especially helpful for people struggling with mental health to manage stress, anxiety, and depression in their everyday life.

There are two versions of this project that are both made in unity. The mobile version uses Vuforia and the HMD version uses the Nreal SDK. 

Our project allows people to journal in the world by creating a written text entry, a voice recording, taking a photo, or a video, and tagging it to a real place. Accessibility features have been added to ensure close captioning is available for individuals who are hard of hearing, smileys can be chosen to show the mood of the post, and the integration with places in the real world encourages active living.

Youâ€™ll also be able to see posts from others who have left a public journal entry. Often, the feeling of anxiety and depression comes with the feeling of isolation and loneliness. This public archive of journals is a reminder that many of these thoughts and feelings are shared. Users can see their personal journal history as well, and can look at the map to see where personal and public entries have been placed.

In the future, we hope to integrate the functionality of the mobile version with the user experience of the Nreal version. We would also like to improve and add more accessibility features, and include sensitive content warnings.

Come join us and start journaling!
